Project Statement

Questions/Hypothesis :

    1. Did the number of incidents of 'petty theft or grand theft' change, when in 2010 Penal Code ยง 487 was amended to increase the amount of property fitting the definition of petty theft.  The amount of property increased from $400 to $950.  Any theft valued at $950 or below is consequently now petty theft; any theft of property with value above $950 is grand theft.
    
    2. Are incidents of petty theft predominant in any particular neighborhood and did the trend change due to the amendment consistently across all?

    3. What is the economic profile of the neighborhood with the highest number of incidents.

    4. Are the trends in SF in line with the general trends in other cities ? ( Stretch goal. Maybe compared to Sacramento)
